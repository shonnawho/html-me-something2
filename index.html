          <h2>Extreme Institue by Nelly</h2>
            <p>In 2013 I enrolled in the Extreme Institue to study recording engineering and music production. For a final project I had to produce, write, and record an ep of five songs.
                Although there are many ways to create an album, I decided to write the lyrics first.</p> <img src="https://www.stlmag.com/downloads/200438/download/holder.jpg?cb=27965ec46fc35b4f55ebeb3670805017" alt="Picture" height="150" width="250"  >

            <h2>The Writing Process</h2>
            <p>With just an accoustic guitar in hand, I would sit in my room for hours and create chord progressions and melodies.
                When I felt that I had something I could work with, I would write it down in my composition notebook. After the writing process next came recording the demos.</p>

            <h2>The Demos</h2>
            <p> I recorded the demos using two music programs, ProTools and Maschine.
                I would start with the melody and chords that I used in the writing process and go from there. I tried to produce at least two different versions of the same song.
                Sometimes the demos would only consit of a sythn track and a steady hi-hat.  Once the demos and writing were done, now it was time for the studio sessions.<a href="https://soundcloud.com/fuzzynipple/destruction-road-demo">Destruction-Road-Demo</a></p>

            <h2>Studio Sessions</h2>
                <p>While in the studio, I took the demos that I had and been working on and built a final track. First I would record the drums, then the guitars, and last but not least my (horrible)vocals. Recording live instruments 
                   in the studio was fun but its also a long process. There would be days when it took 8 hrs and multiple takes just to get the right recording.</p>

            <h2>Mixing and Editing</h2>
                        <p>Mixing and editing was by far the most challenging part of the process. Mixing the multiple tracks came first. A little EQ and a little compression is always good but then came the tedious process of editing. 
                            For the most part I didn't really have to edit any of the instrument tracks but them vocals tho!!! Due to the fact tha I'm not a natural born singer, I had to do alot of editing to the vocals. Alot of copy,cut, and paste was going on.</p>

            <h2 id="FP">Final Project</h2>
                    <p>Finally after six long weeks of recording, mixing , and editing (those horrible vocals) my project was finally finished.
